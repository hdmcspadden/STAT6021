# Module 03: Inference
How do we assess whether there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the predictor and response variables?


How do we estimate the mean value of the response variable for a specific value of the predictor variable?


How do we predict the value of the response variable for a specific value of the predictor variable?

## Objectives
Describe what questions are addressed by the various confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in a simple linear regression.

Given a data set and a question of interest, identify what inferential procedure to use in a simple linear regression setting.

# 2.1 Intro
Red bead experiment: random variation of samples

# 2.2 Hypothesis Testing in Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

Read Section 2.3 of your textbook. As you read, take notes on the following.
 
## 1. In a hypothesis test for the slope, when do we use a t statistic instead of a z statistic? Which statistic, t or z, is more commonly used in a real-world setting? Briefly explain.

When the population standard deviaton, sigma2 is unknown, we cant use Z stat. So we use t stat.

t0 is a test statistc used to test H0 = B1 = Bx.

WE reject H0 IFF abs(t0) > t(alpha/a, n-2)

t is more commonly known because a true census of a population is often realistically impossible. Imagine trying to capture all characteristics of ALL fruitflies.


## 2. Write down the formula for the standard error of the slope, se(Î²^1). 

se(B^1) == standard error of estimated slope

se(B^1) == sqrt(MS-res / Sxx)


**T STATISTIC FOR NOT H0: B1 = 0**
B1-hat - (Test B1) / (Std. Error of B1-hat from R) - use summar of lm(y~x)

## 3. Explain why the standard error of the slope decreases as the fit of the model improves. 

As the fit improves the MS-res (or errors unexplained by the model) decrease, thus the numerator decreases making se(B^1) decrease.


## 4. Consider a situation in which we want to test to assess whether or not there is a linear relationship between the predictor and response variable.
**How do we write the null and alternative hypotheses?** Express the hypotheses using statistical notation and describe what these expressions mean in words. 

**What is the formula for the t statistic?** 
Do you think a larger or smaller t statistic, in magnitude, leads to more evidence against the null hypothesis? 

t0 = (B^1 - B10) / se(B^1) where se(B^1) == sqrt(MS-res / Sxx)

A **larger t0** provides more evidence because the denominator will be smaller and the numerator will be larger is B1 != B10 (and a greater difference == larger numerator and smaller denominator)


**What distribution do we compare the t statistic to? **

We reject H0 IFF abs(t0) > t(alpha/a, n-2)


## 5. Explain why the t-test for the slope gives the same result as the ANOVA F test in an SLR setting.

F0 = MS-R / MS-res

MS-R == B1-hat^2(Sxx)

t0 = B1-hat / se(B1-hat)

t0 = B1-hat / sqrt(MS-res / Sxx)

square both top and bottom

multiple both top and bottom by Sxx

== F0


# 2.3 Confidence Interval of the Slope

## 1. Write down the formula for the confidence interval of the slope. 
For this confidence interval: 

CI for B1-hat

B1-hat - t-alpha/2,n-2(se(B1-hat)) <= B1-hat <= B1-hat + t-alpha/2,n-2(se(B1-hat))

**How does increasing the level of confidence affect the width of this confidence interval? **

**Answer**
an increase in confidence level means that the abs(t-value) increases, so **the range of B1-hat increases.**
```{r}
tmulti1 <- abs(qt(0.975, 8)) # t multiplier for 95% 2-sided, with n==10
print(tmulti1)

tmulti2 <- abs(qt(0.995, 8)) # t multiplier for 99% 2-sided, with n==10
print(tmulti2)
```


**How does model fit affect the width of this confidence interval? **
The model fit is illustrated by the se(B1-hat). A better fit is a smaller se(B1-hat), so the interval for the same confidence level will be smaller because the corrections will be smaller.



## 2.Describe, in your own words, what a confidence interval of the slope tells us. 

CI of slope tells us the our confidence for the estimated slope of the linear equation lying within a given range. I think of it as a shaded area shaped like an hourglass around the midpoint of the line. we want a smaller hourglass.

# 2.4 Confidence Interval of the Mean Response

## 1. Write down the formula for the confidence interval of the mean response. For this confidence interval: 

E(y|x0) == estimate of mean of y given value of x0.

== B0-hat + B1-hat(x)

See Equation 2.43 on page 31


**How does increasing the level of confidence affect the width of this confidence interval? **

increasing confidence == means the subtraction and addition from the mean increases, which increases the range of the estimate of mean response.


**How does model fit affect the width of this confidence interval? **
If the model fit is better then MS-res is smaller which is a weight on the t-value, so less is added or subtracted from E(y|x0), so the range of the CI decreases.



**How does the width of this confidence interval change as the value of the predictor variable moves farther away from the sample mean of the predictor? **

As x0 moves further away from X-bar, the multiplier/weight on the t-value increases, so the CI range increases.

At x-bar, the multiplier is 1/n, so the larger the sample size, the smaller the CI range.


## 2. Describe, in your own words, what a confidence interval of the mean response tells us. 
 
CI of the mean of y at a particular value of x tells us how well our model performs as x changes. The more stable the CI as x changes from the mean, the better our model predcts at the extremes of x.

# 2.5  Prediction Interval of a New Response

## 1. Write down the formula for the prediction interval of a new response. For this prediction interval: 

y0-hat = B0-hat + b1-hat(x0) is how to predict new value

y0 - all stuff, instead of y-bar - all stuff

THe estimator in the CI changed

**How does increasing the level of confidence affect the width of this interval? **

Increasing confidence increases range of interval (t value gets larger)


**How does model fit affect the width of this interval? **

Model fit reduces MS-res so the range of the CI decreases.

**How does the width of this change as the value of the predictor variable moves farther away from the sample mean of the predictor? **

As x0 moves further from x-bar the correction increases, so the range of the CI increases.
 
## 2. Describe, in your own words, what a prediction interval of a new response tells us. 

It is a X% confidence that the value of a future response variable for a given predictor variable will be within the prediction interval.

## 3. Compare the standard errors associated with the confidence interval of the mean response and the prediction interval of a new response. Which is larger? Explain why that answer makes practical sense.

Stanard errors of prediction variable will be larger than the errors of the mean response. It makes sense because the mean response naturally allows for variation, but predicting a specific value is more difficult.
