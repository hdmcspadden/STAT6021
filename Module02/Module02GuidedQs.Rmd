# Module 03: Inference
How do we assess whether there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the predictor and response variables?


How do we estimate the mean value of the response variable for a specific value of the predictor variable?


How do we predict the value of the response variable for a specific value of the predictor variable?

## Objectives
Describe what questions are addressed by the various confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in a simple linear regression.

Given a data set and a question of interest, identify what inferential procedure to use in a simple linear regression setting.

# 2.1 Intro



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
