# 1.2 Simple Linear Regression

## 1. Write down the simple linear regression equation and the simple linear regression model.

**Model**
y = B0 + B1x

**Equation**
y-hat = B0-hat + B1-hat(x)


## 2. Compare and contrast the simple linear regression equation and the simple linear regression model. What do each of these describe?

**Model**
Describes the linear relationship of x to y. This is the population model that best describes, with the least regression and residual error the relationship of x to y.

**Equation**
Gives a point estimate for the mean of y for a particular x. In other words, what is an estimate of the average y, for an x.

## 3. What is the interpretation associated with the slope and intercept in a simple linear regression equation?

The slope, B1, the change in y by a unit change in x.

The y-intercept is the fitted-model's estimate for y-bar for an x of 0, but 0 may not be in the range of x, and thus, B0 may have no logical meaning.

## 4. Write down the assumptions for a simple linear regression model. You may state the assumptions using equations, and then describe what these equations mean.

**Assumption 1:** the errors of the model have a mean of 0.
**Assumption 2:** the variance of errors is unknown.
**Assumption 3:** errors are uncorrelated - do not depend on any other error.
