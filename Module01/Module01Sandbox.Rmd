# 1.2 Simple Linear Regression

## 1. Write down the simple linear regression equation and the simple linear regression model.

**Model**
y = B0 + B1x

**Equation**
y-hat = B0-hat + B1-hat(x)


## 2. Compare and contrast the simple linear regression equation and the simple linear regression model. What do each of these describe?

**Model**
Describes the linear relationship of x to y. This is the population model that best describes, with the least regression and residual error the relationship of x to y.

**Equation**
Gives a point estimate for the mean of y for a particular x. In other words, what is an estimate of the average y, for an x.

## 3. What is the interpretation associated with the slope and intercept in a simple linear regression equation?

The slope, B1, the change in y by a unit change in x.

The y-intercept is the fitted-model's estimate for y-bar for an x of 0, but 0 may not be in the range of x, and thus, B0 may have no logical meaning.

## 4. Write down the assumptions for a simple linear regression model. You may state the assumptions using equations, and then describe what these equations mean.

**Assumption 1:** the errors of the model have a mean of 0.
**Assumption 2:** the variance of errors is unknown.
**Assumption 3:** errors are uncorrelated - do not depend on any other error.

# 1.3 Estimating Regression Coefficients

## 1. Write down the estimated simple linear regression equation and the estimated simple linear regression model.

**Model**
y = B0 + B1x

**Equation**
y-hat = B0-hat + B1-hat(x)


## 2. Compare and contrast the estimated simple linear regression equation and the estimated simple linear regression model. What do each of these describe?

**Model**
Describes the linear relationship of x to y. This is the population model that best describes, with the least regression and residual error the relationship of x to y.

**Equation**
Gives a point estimate for the mean of y for a particular x. In other words, what is an estimate of the average y, for an x.


## 3. Write down the formulas for the following. Also, explain in words what these are describing.
**Predicted / fitted value:**
y-hat = B-hat0 + B-hat1(x)
An estimate of the average value of the response variable (y) for a particular predictor variable (x).
so, if you have all the values of y for a given x, the predicted/fitted value is the average value of all the y's, but the model creates a linear equation for all values of x, to minmize errors/variance of y-i, y-hat, and y-bar.

**Residuals
Residuals are the difference between the actual value of y, y-i, and the predicted value of y, y-hat.
residuals, (e-i) = (y-i) - (y-hat). Residuals are variances that cannot be explained in the model.

## 4. Describe, using your own words, how the regression coefficients are estimated using  least-squares criterion.
The regression coef's, B0 and B1, are estimated by ...
**First, estimate B1, i.e. the slope, as Sxy / Sxx.**
Sxy is the sum of cross products of x-i's and y-i's corrected by the average sum of (x-i)(y-i).

Sxx is the sum of squares of (x-i) - (x-bar)

After you have an estimate for B1, you can estimate B0. Using mean of y (y-bar) and mean of x (x-bar):
B0-hat = y-bar - B1-hat(x-bar), this is from the simple linear regression formula.


## 5. Write down the formulas for the least-squares estimators for the coefficients of a simple linear regression equation.

See #4.

## 6. The least-squares estimators for the regression coefficients are called the best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE). Describe, using your own words, what BLUE means.

Best linear unbiased estimate means that the the regression coefs, B0 and B1, have been calculated to result in the least variance possible, i.e. the least deviation from the average y for given x, based on the given data set.
