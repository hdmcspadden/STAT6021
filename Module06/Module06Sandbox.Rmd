# Module 06: Categorical Variables

Categorial, aka Qualitative Variables

observations into groups

What are the differences in the MLR model when predictors are categorical.

## ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
1. How do we use indicator variables for categorical predictors in an MLR model?
1. What does it mean when there is an interaction between the predictors?
1. How do we interpret the MLR model when we have categorical predictors, with and without interaction?

## 6.2 Indicator Variables

Read Sections 8.1 to 8.2 of your textbook.

1. Describe how you would use indicator variables for this regression. 

**Answer**
Indicator variables are quantitative variables whose quant value is assigned based on a qualitative value of the corresponding categorical variable(s).

read pages 261 and 262 for desctriptions of indicator variables

In general, a qualitative variable with a levels is represented by (a-1) regressor variables (binary switches with values 0 or 1)


2. What is the interpretation of the regression coefficients β0, β1, β2 when there are no interactions? How does the interpretation change when there is interaction between the predictors? 

**Answer No Interactions**

When slopes are the same:

B0: When category is category 0, and quantitative variable is 0.

B1: In the book example, B1 is the change in response variable when the quantitative variable changes by 1 unit

B2: In the book example, B2 is the change in response variable when indicator variable changes from category 0 to category 1. and 95% confidence interval of B2 is described as "95% confidence that changing from category 0 to category 1 increases mean tool life between B2 low to B2 high."


When slopes are different:

For category 0:
B0: this is the intercept

B1: slope of category 0 

For categoyry 1:

Intercept is B0 + B2

Slope is B1 + B3

Where B3 is coefficient of x1x2

**Answer Interactions**


Add multiplier terms

E.g.
where :

x1 = square footage of home

x2, x3, x4 == 0 == no airconditioning

x2 = 1, x3,x4 = 0 == window units

x3 = 1, x2,x4 = 0 == heat pump

x4 = 1, x2,x3 = 0 == central air

Equation looks like:

**Y-hat = B0 + B1x1 + B2x2 + B3x3 + B4x4 + B5x1x2 + B6x1x3 + B7x1x4 + E**

**Interpreations of Coefficients**

3. Describe, in your own words, what interaction between the predictors means. 



4. What assumption are we making regarding the model variance, σ2, when using indicator variables?
